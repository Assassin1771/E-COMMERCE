Created a Complete Full Stack Application on the theme E-Commerce Store.

I have used React, Redux and Ant Design for designing the FrontEnd and User Interface. Then I have used Firebase for User Authentication. The backend is handled with the help of Node and MongoDB.

FAQ:
1. Why given Add to Cart option before Login?
To show that website is user friendly and it is human tendency to look for items and add to cart, instead of logging or signing up first.

2. Types of Users?
Only 2, One is admin and other are normal customers. Both have different dashboards.
